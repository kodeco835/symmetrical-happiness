Uploading your app to TestFlight and Google Play beta can be time consuming and limiting (e.g. TestFlight can only have one active build at a time). You can skip these services entirely by building binaries that can be downloaded and installed to physical devices directly from a web browser.

EAS Build can help you with this by providing sharable URLs for your builds with instructions on how to get them running, so you can share a single URL with a teammate that'll include all of the information they need to test the app.

> ðŸ˜… Installing an app on iOS is a bit trickier than on Android, but it's possible thanks to ad hoc and enterprise provisioning profiles. We'll talk more about this later in this doc.

The following three steps will guide you through adding internal distribution to a project that is [already set up to build with EAS Build](setup.md). It will only take a few minutes in total to: configure the project, add a couple of test iOS devices to a provisioning profile, and start builds for Android and iOS.

## 1. Configure a build profile

Open up `eas.json` and add a new build profile for iOS and/or Android.

```json
{
  "builds": {
    "android": {
      "preview": {
        /* @info valid values: store, internal. defaults to store */
        "distribution": "internal",
        /* @end */
        "workflow": "generic"
      }
    },
    "ios": {
      "preview": {
        /* @info valid values: store, internal. defaults to store */
        "distribution": "internal",
        /* @end */
        "workflow": "generic"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> If you override the `gradleCommand` on Android, you should ensure that it produces an `apk` rather than an `aab`, so it is directly installable to an Android device.

## 2. Configure app signing

### 2.1 Configure app signing credentials for Android

Android does not restrict distribution of applications &mdash; the operating system is capable of installing any compatible `apk` file. As a result, configuring app signing credentials for internal distribution is no different from other types of builds. The main benefit of using internal distribution in this case is to have an easily shareable URL to provide to testers for downloading the app.

### 2.2 Configure app signing credentials for iOS

Apple restricts distribution of applications on iPhones and iPads, so we will need to build the app with an ad-hoc provisioning profile that explicitly lists the devices that the application can run on.

An alternative to ad hoc provisioning is enterprise provisioning, but this is expensive (\$299 USD per year from Apple) and not yet supported by EAS Build internal distribution (support is planned and coming soon).

### Enterprise provisioning

If you plan on using enterprise provisioning, please sign in to the account with [Apple Developer Enterprise Program membership](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/). You probably don't have this, and it's expensive (\$299 USD per year) and takes time to acquire, so you will likely be using ad hoc provisioning &mdash; this works on any normal paid Apple developer account.

### Setting up enterprise provisioning

If you do have an Apple enterprise account, this makes internal distribution much easier for users who want to install your app for the first time. Once they install the profile to their device they can access the app right away. One limitation of using an enterprise provisioning profile is that you will need to have a distinct bundle identifier from the one that you use to publish your app to the App Store. (@brentvatne: after this is a bad idea intentionally, we should probably have a config option, i'm just putting it there so we have something for now) We recommend setting your bundle identifier for internal distribution and committing that change on another branch. After that, whenever you want to create a preview branch you can check out that branch and rebase against the branch you'd like to create a build for.

#### Registering iOS and iPadOS devices for ad hoc provisioning

Apps signed with an ad hoc provisioning profile can be installed by any iOS device whose unique identifier (UDID) is registered with the provisioning profile.

Setting up ad hoc provisioning consists of two steps. In the first step, you'll register devices that you want to be able to install your app. Run the following command to generate a URL (and QR code, for convenience) that you can open on your devices, and then follow the instructions on the registration page.

<TerminalBlock cmd={['# Register Apple Devices for internal distribution', 'eas device:create']} />

You can register new devices at any time, but builds that were created before the device was registered will not run on newly registered devices; only builds that are created after the device is registered will be installable.

The next step is to generate or update the provisioning profile. When you proceed to running a build, you will be guided through this process.

> **Are you using manual local credentials?** Make sure to point your `credentials.json` to an ad hoc <!-- or enterprise -->provisioning profile that you generate through the Apple Developer portal. Beware that EAS CLI does only a limited validation of your local credentials, and you will have to handle device UDID registration manually. Read more about [using local credentials](/app-signing/local-credentials.md).

## 3. Run a build with the internal build profile

Now that we have set up our build profile and app signing, running a build for internal distribution is just like any other build.

<TerminalBlock cmd={['# Create iOS and Android builds for internal distribution', 'eas build --profile preview --platform all']} />

If you choose to let EAS CLI manage your ad hoc provisioning profile, we will show you the list of all devices registered so far. You will then be prompted to confirm you want to proceed with those devices.

When the build completes, you will be given a URL that you can share with your team to download and install the app.

<!--
(@dsokal) this is not implemented yet

If the device you would like to distribute to is not currently registered, you can choose to register it now (or exit the current command and run `eas device:add` again). The build command will wait for the new device to register. Scan the QR code that is presented in the terminal and follow the instructions on that page to register your device. When you're done, return to the terminal and press return to continue. You should see that your new device registration has been detected and added to the profile.

You can add another if you like, otherwise continue.

When using iOS adhoc provisioning managed by Expo, if a teammate navigates to this URL on an iOS device that is not yet registered, they will be able to register their device and initiate a new build to include the updated profile that will run on their device. If the adhoc provisioning profile is not managed by Expo, the user will be asked to contact the organization admin in order to add their device UDID and create a new build compatible with their device.
