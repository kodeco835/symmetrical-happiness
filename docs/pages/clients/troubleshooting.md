### The --dev-client flag is not supported in expo-cli

You will need to upgrade your expo-cli to version 4.0.16 or above to use your development client

### The keyboard shortcuts for the Dev Menu don't work reliably in my iOS simulator

Make sure you have `Send keyboard input to device` enabled for the simulator. This option can be found under `I/O` > `Input in the menu`.
