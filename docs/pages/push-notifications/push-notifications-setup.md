import { Tab, Tabs } from '~/components/plugins/Tabs';

To get the client-side ready for push notifications, the 2 main things we need are:

- The user's permission to send them push notifications
- The user's ExpoPushToken- if push notifications are mail, then the ExpoPushToken is the user's address.

We can easily grab both of these using the `expo-notifications` library. For permissions, use [`requestPermissionsAsync`](../versions/latest/sdk/notifications.md#requestpermissionsasyncrequest-notificationpermissionsrequest-promisenotificationpermissionsstatus), and for the ExpoPushToken, use [`getExpoPushTokenAsync`](../versions/latest/sdk/notifications.md#getexpopushtokenasyncoptions-expotokenoptions-expopushtoken).

> Note: in the managed workflow, you don't need to pass any additional options to `getExpoPushTokenAsync`. In the bare workflow, you'll need to pass your `experienceId`. Make sure you read the documentation for more information.

The following method takes care of all this for you, so feel free to copy/paste it.

## Credentials

If you're using the bare workflow, or building a standalone app with `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`, you'll also need to configure the necessary push credentials.

For Android, both managed and bare workflow users need to follow our [FCM setup guide](using-fcm.md), it should only take about 5 minutes.

For iOS, the managed workflow takes care of push notification credentials automatically when you run `expo build:ios`. In the bare workflow, you'll need to use the `expo credentials:manager` command to upload your push notification credentials to Expo's servers. Follow these steps:

1. Make sure your `ios.bundleIdentifier` key in `app.json` is set.
2. Make sure you've created the relevant provisioning profile for your app in the [Apple Developer Console](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list)
3. Run `expo credentials:manager -p ios` in your project directory.
4. Select `Add new Push Notifications Key` (or `Use existing Push Notifications Key in current project` if you already have one)

> Note: A paid Apple Developer Account is **required** to generate credentials.
